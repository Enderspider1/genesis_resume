This is the code for a firefox extension (I believe it should also work with most other browsers but I havent tested it directly) that allows the user to costomize the size and font of text on any webpage. 
The interface also uses colour and font choices that contrast strongly for all kinds of colour blindness, as recomended by accesibility guides.
Here is a guide on how to enable it in firefox if you wish to test its functionality.
  1. Locate the extensions button at the top right of the browser, click it and press the "manage extensions" button.
  2. In the extensions menu click on the settings button and hit "Debug Add-ons"
  3. in the new tab that opens press load temporary add ons, and navigate to where this folder is saved.
  4. select the manifest.json file
  5. The extension is now available in your extensions tab, click it to begin altering the current web page.

If you ever wish to revert the page back to it's original state, simply refresh the page and any chenges will be undone.
