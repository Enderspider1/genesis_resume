This is a database that I created for my ICS3U summative.
Songs can be added by typing in their name, the artist, the length in seconds, and as many or as few tags as desired, seperated by a comma. All of these inputs should be done in their coresponding fields
If I remember correctly including a "|" symbol in any of these fields can cause problems, that is a known issue that was just outside of the scope of the project at the time.
Songs can be removed by typing in the full name of it's title and artist in the delete field, and then pressing the delete button.
The database can also be searched through by typing any String in the search field and pressing enter, and the database will only display the songs that include that string somewhere, this is where the custom tags can be usefull.
The database can also be sorted to display the songs in alphabetical order by title, artist, or duration. This can be done with the restrictions of the search function.

I also created the entire program in repl.it and at the time of writing this I havnt tested it's ability to run through other means. For the purpose of the resume I will test its ability to run outside the repl.it program, and either adjust it to run on my own personal machine, or atatch a video of it running and demonstrating its functionality.
