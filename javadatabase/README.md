This is a database that I created for my ICS3U summative.
Songs can be added by typing in their name, the artist, the length in seconds, and as many or as few tags as desired, seperated by a comma. All of these inputs should be done in their coresponding fields

Songs can be removed by typing in the full name of it's title and artist in the delete field, and then pressing the delete button.
The database can also be searched through by typing any String in the search field and pressing enter, and the database will only display the songs that include that string somewhere, this is where the custom tags can be usefull.
The database can also be sorted to display the songs in alphabetical order by title, artist, or duration. This can be done with the restrictions of the search function.

There is an image atatched of the display to quickly see what the program looks like. the file is "preview_image"
